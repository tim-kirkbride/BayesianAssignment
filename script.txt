Hi,
I'm _ and I'm here with _, _ and _, and we're presenting our report
on predicting Black Friday Sales via Bayesian Muliple Regression.

Slide 2:
For a quick overview, Black Friday is a shopping event which originated
in the US. On black friday, retails have extended shopping hours and 
offer sales on their items, which leads to high sales and often even 
results in violence between shoppers and staff. As Black friday is associted
with such high sales, we thought it would be interesting to try and 
see if certain kinds of shoppers were more likely to spend more on average, 
and whether we could predict sales based on this.

Slide 3:
Ulitmately, we attempted to fit a bayesian multiple regression to black friday 
sales data in order to predict average sales per shopper. We began our
analysis by preprocessing the data to get it into a usable format. We then
investigated the cleaned data via descriptive and visual analysis. Following this,
we constructed a bayesian model diagram and associated R/jags code to run MCMC simulations
using non-informative prior information. Here, the data was split into
training and test sets and the test data was used to generate predictions. 
MCMC chain diagnostics were then checked and posterior distribtuions were interpreted. 
Finally, the generated predictions were compared to the actual average sales values to 
get a sense of model accuracy.

Slide 4:
The dataset we used was obtained from kaggle and can be accessed from the link here.
With regards to processing, the data orginially had numerous observations which related to the same
individuals, so the data was aggregated so that each individual was represented once. In doing so, the average 
sales column (the response varaible) was created to represent each persons average spent. Lastly,
all factor column levels were converted into individual binary dummy variables.

The model that we used for analysis is shown in this model diagram. Here it can be seen that we were assuming that the prior distributions were non-informative

===SLIDE 10===

With this diagram in mind, a model was created and run with the full set of independent variables provided in the dataset. After this initial run, non-significant predictors were identified and removed. 

We then ran a new reduced model which will be the basis for all of the following results. For this final MCMC run, we used 100 000 iterations with a thinning of 15, as well as a burn in period of 5000 and 5000 adaption steps. 

===SLIDE 11===

This final model was then implemented through the code shown here.

===SLIDE 12===

We were very happy with the model diagnostics seen here with an example of the beta diagnostics shown here.

We can see very good representation in the almost entirely overlapping chains. Other features of the model diagnostics that we pleased with are the accuracy of the model which can be seen in the extremely small MCSE value and the almost immediately flattening shrink factor and autocorrelation plots. 

These results were not unique to just beta0 with all beta diagnostic plots showing similar outcomes

===SLIDE 13===

The sigma diagnostic plots also show very good results. Like the previous beta diagnostics the chains completely overlap, the shrink factor and autocorrelation immediately flatten and the density plot has a nearly perfect normal distribution. These results give us a high level of confidence in the model.
